A proof of concept demonstrating the
> possibility of extending the SVG spec to include a `<replicate>` tag for the purposes of extending functionality into three primary areas: 1. richer classes of gradients, 2. extensions to new classes of patterns and 3. new types of 2.5 dimensional objects<sup>*</sup>.

The `<replicate>` element is seen as having a similar relationship to 2D space that `<animate>` and its cousins from the SMIL family have to time. That is, `<replicate>` can be used to perform declarative construction of clusters of related shapes.

An extension to SVG, the `<replicate>` tag, implemented in JavaScript.
